1. About Java
Java has been one of the most popular programming languages since 1996.
It has around 10 million developers worldwide.
It is suitable for everything from small devices to large enterprise applications.

2. What is Java?
Java was developed as a high-level programming language by Sun Microsystems in 1996.
Today, Java is not only a programming language—it is also a platform, development environment, and runtime environment.

3. Why Was Java Created?
There was a need for a cross-platform language for multi-device development.
C++, though powerful and object-oriented, was resource-intensive and not ideal for portable applications.
Java was built around the philosophy:
“Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)”

4. How is Java Platform Independent?
Traditional Model
Source Code → Native Machine Code

Java Programming Model
Source Code → Bytecode → JVM Execution

Internal Execution Flow

Java Program → generates a .class file
Class Loader loads the class
Bytecode Verifier verifies the bytecode
Interpreter / JIT Compiler interprets or compiles it
Execution Engine runs the code
Interaction with the host system hardware

5. JVM, JRE, and JDK
JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
Executes Java bytecode
Provides platform independence
JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
Contains JVM + core libraries
Needed to run Java applications
JDK (Java Development Kit)
Contains JRE + compiler (javac) + tools
Needed to develop Java applications

6. Features of Java
Platform Independent
Compiled and Interpreted
Object-Oriented
Simple
Robust & Secure
Dynamic
