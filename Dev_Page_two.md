# Identifiers 
- Names used for classes, methods, interfaces, and variables are called Identifiers.
- All identifiers must start with either a letter, currency character ($), or a connecting character like underscore (_).
- A Java keyword cannot be used as an identifier.
- Identifiers in Java are case-sensitive.
