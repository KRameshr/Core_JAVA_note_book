## Core Java – Introduction

Java continues to be one of the most influential programming languages in the world. Known for its <br/>
robustness, platform independence, and vast ecosystem, Java powers everything from mobile apps to   <br/>
massive enterprise systems.

This article provides a crisp introduction to the language—its origins, purpose, components, features, and evolution.

# 1. About Java

Java has remained one of the most popular programming languages since 1996. <br/>
With more than 10 million developers worldwide, Java is used in:

- Mobile applications  
- Desktop applications  
- Embedded systems  
- Cloud-based enterprise applications  
- Big data & distributed systems  

Its versatility and reliability make it suitable for projects of all scales—from tiny devices to massive corporate solutions.

# 2. What is Java?

Java was originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1996 as a high-level, object-oriented programming language. <br/>
Today, Java is more than just a language — it is also:
- ✔ A platform
- ✔ A development environment
- ✔ A runtime environment


This combination is what makes Java a comprehensive ecosystem for building modern applications.

# 3. Why Was Java Created?

During the mid-90s, the industry needed a language that could run on multiple devices without requiring major changes.

Although C++ was powerful and widely used, it was:

Resource-intensive

Platform-dependent

Not ideal for building portable applications

So Java was designed with a game-changing philosophy:

🌍 “Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)”

This enabled developers to write code once and run it on any system with a compatible JVM.

🖥️ 4. How Does Java Achieve Platform Independence?
🔸 Traditional Programming Model
Source Code → Native Machine Code


This binds programs to a specific operating system.

🔹 Java Programming Model
Source Code → Bytecode → JVM Execution


The compiler converts Java code into a platform-neutral bytecode, which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

⚙ Internal Execution Flow

Java program generates a .class file (bytecode)

Class Loader loads the class

Bytecode Verifier checks for security and correctness

Interpreter / JIT Compiler processes bytecode

Execution Engine executes the instructions

Interacts with the underlying system hardware

This layered structure ensures both security and portability.

🧩 5. JVM, JRE, and JDK Explained
🔸 JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

Executes Java bytecode

Provides platform independence

Core of the Java runtime environment

🔸 JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

Contains JVM + essential Java libraries

Required to run Java applications

🔸 JDK (Java Development Kit)

Contains JRE + compiler (javac) + development tools

Required to develop Java applications

⭐ 6. Key Features of Java

Platform Independent

Compiled & Interpreted

Object-Oriented

Simple & Easy to Learn

Robust & Secure

Dynamic & Extensible

Java’s design ensures reliability, maintainability, and high performance across all environments.

🕰️ 7. Evolution of Java Versions
Version	Release Date
JDK 1.0	January 23, 1996
JDK 1.1	February 19, 1997
J2SE 1.2	December 8, 1998
J2SE 1.3	May 8, 2000
J2SE 1.4	February 6, 2002
J2SE 5.0	September 30, 2004
Java SE 6	December 11, 2006
Java SE 7	July 7, 2011
Java SE 8	March 18, 2014

Each version introduced new enhancements, libraries, and performance upgrades—especially Java 8, which revolutionized Java with streams, lambdas, and functional programming.

🎉 Conclusion

Java remains a powerhouse in the software industry. Its philosophy, architecture, and ever-growing ecosystem make it a top choice for developers worldwide.

If you're starting your journey into programming, Java is one of the best places to begin.
